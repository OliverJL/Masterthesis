\section{Discussion}

'It has been shown that the overlapping template matching test included in the NIST randomness test suite uses the inaccurate occurrence probabilities PI of the template.'
\cite{hamano2007correction,chen2016templates}. \cite{chen2016templates} proposal of approach, identification of relevant templates by correlation check. If templates B \&  B' have low correlation
both are selected for a test. If the correlation is high just one of both is chosen, as it is assumed to represent the discarded to the greatest extent. This approach reduces the amount of templates significantly (50 \%) \cite{chen2016templates}.
